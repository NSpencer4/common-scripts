# Change sizing and atomic commits

Merged selectively from addyosmani `git-commit`.

**Authority:** Repository `AGENTS.md` / global Git rules override this file. Do **not** create commits or push unless the user asks (or standing repo rules explicitly approve after validation). Treat "commit early, commit often" as "leave the tree in reviewable slices; commit when asked."

### 2. Atomic Commits

Each commit does one logical thing:

```
# Good: Each commit is self-contained
git log --oneline
a1b2c3d Add task creation endpoint with validation
d4e5f6g Add task creation form component
h7i8j9k Connect form to API and add loading state
m1n2o3p Add task creation tests (unit + integration)

# Bad: Everything mixed together
git log --oneline
x1y2z3a Add task feature, fix sidebar, update deps, refactor utils
```

### 3. Descriptive Messages

Commit messages explain the *why*, not just the *what*:

```
# Good: Explains intent
feat: add email validation to registration endpoint

Prevents invalid email formats from reaching the database.
Uses Zod schema validation at the route handler level,
consistent with existing validation patterns in auth.ts.

# Bad: Describes what's obvious from the diff
update auth.ts
```

**Format:**
```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body explaining why, not what>
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Tooling, dependencies, config

### 4. Keep Concerns Separate

Don't combine formatting changes with behavior changes. Don't combine refactors with features. Each type of change should be a separate commit - and ideally a separate PR:

```
# Good: Separate concerns
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation logic to shared utility"
git commit -m "feat: add phone number validation to registration"

# Bad: Mixed concerns
git commit -m "refactor validation and add phone number field"
```

**Separate refactoring from feature work.** A refactoring change and a feature change are two different changes - submit them separately. This makes each change easier to review, revert, and understand in history. Small cleanups (renaming a variable) can be included in a feature commit at reviewer discretion.

### 5. Size Your Changes

Target ~100 lines per commit/PR. Changes over ~1000 lines should be split. See the splitting strategies in `code-review` for how to break down large changes.

```
~100 lines  → Easy to review, easy to revert
~300 lines  → Acceptable for a single logical change
~1000 lines → Split into smaller changes
```
